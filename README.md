# Landau_3_reedited
A project of which target is to reedit the English version of Course of Theoretical Physics Volume 3: Quantum Mehchanics (non-relativistic theory) by L. D. Landau.
## Introduction
This project is originated from the problem I have faced while I was reading the English version of Landau's quantum mechanics that the typesetting was so terrible that I could hardly bear it. Nevertheless, I found by chance [the Russian version of this book](https://github.com/Arendelle-ftl/Landau_3_reedited/blob/main/Landau-3-reedited/%D0%A2%D0%B5%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8F%20%D1%84%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0.%20%D0%92%2010%20%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%85.%20%D0%A2%D0%BE%D0%BC%2003.%20%D0%9A%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%8F%20%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%85%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0%20%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8F%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8F%20%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%8F%20by%20%D0%9B%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%B0%D1%83%20%D0%9B.%D0%94.%2C%20%D0%9B%D0%B8%D1%84%D1%88%D0%B8%D1%86%20%D0%95.%D0%9C.%20(z-lib.org).pdf) of which typesetting is good. Consequently, I have come up with the idea that is reediting the English version in accordance with the typesetting  of the Russian version. Luckily, I have obtained the [txt file of the English version](https://github.com/Arendelle-ftl/Landau_3_reedited/blob/main/Landau-3-reedited/(Course%20of%20theoretical%20physics%203)%20Landau%2C%20Lev%20Davidovi%C4%8D_Lif%C5%A1its%2C%20Evgenij%20M%20-%20Quantum%20mechanics_%20non-relativistic%20theory-Elsevier%20Science_Butterworth-Heinemann%20(2005_1977)(2).txt) which would make the reeditting work much more easier. The steps and Remarks of this work is displayed below.
## Steps
1. Fork this repository
2. Select a chapter you want to reedit
3. Copy the text associated with this chapter from the [txt file](https://github.com/Arendelle-ftl/Landau_3_reedited/blob/main/Landau-3-reedited/(Course%20of%20theoretical%20physics%203)%20Landau%2C%20Lev%20Davidovi%C4%8D_Lif%C5%A1its%2C%20Evgenij%20M%20-%20Quantum%20mechanics_%20non-relativistic%20theory-Elsevier%20Science_Butterworth-Heinemann%20(2005_1977)(2).txt)
4. Create a new tex file in [src folder](https://github.com/Arendelle-ftl/Landau_3_reedited/tree/main/Landau-3-reedited/src)
5. Paste the text in this tex file and then reedit all the footnotes, figures and equations in accordance with the Russian version
6. Add the tex file of the chapter you have completely reedited to the mainmatter of [main.tex](https://github.com/Arendelle-ftl/Landau_3_reedited/blob/main/Landau-3-reedited/main.tex)
7. Send me a pull request 
## Remarks
### Elementary rules of reediting
1. All of the footnotes, figures and equations should be accordance with those of Russian version
2. Based on 1. we need make a few improvements:
- Use mathrm font of differential operator d, imaginary unit i and the base of natural logarithm e
- Use \varepsilon, \varphi, \uppi, \widehat, \widetilde, \overline instead of \epsilon, \phi, \pi, \hat, \tilde, \bar
- Some renewcommands about these rules have been set in [landaubook.cls](https://github.com/Arendelle-ftl/Landau_3_reedited/blob/main/Landau-3-reedited/landaubook.cls)
```tex
\renewcommand{\phi}{\varphi}
\renewcommand{\hat}{\widehat}
\renewcommand{\tilde}{\widetilde}
\renewcommand{\bar}{\overline}
\renewcommand{\i}{\mathrm{i}}
\renewcommand{\d}{\mathrm{d}}
\newcommand{\p}{\partial}
\newcommand{\h}{\hbar}
\newcommand{\e}{\mathrm{e}}
\renewcommand{\pi}{\uppi}
\renewcommand\thefigure{\arabic{figure}}
\renewcommand{\epsilon}{\varepsilon}
```
### The chapters left to myself to reedit
For some reasons, apart from the first three chapters I have completed the reediting, **chapter IV ANGULAR MOMENTUM, chapter VI PERTURBATION THEORY, chapter VIII SPIN, chapter IX IDENTITY OF PARTICLES and MATHEMATICAL APPENDICES are left to myself**, you could select any other chapters to reedit.
