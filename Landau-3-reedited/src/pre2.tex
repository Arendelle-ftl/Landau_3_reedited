\chapter{PREFACE TO THE SECOND ENGLISH EDITION}
FOR this second edition the book has been considerably revised and enlarged, but the general plan and style remain as before. Every chapter has been revised. In particular, extensive changes have been made in the sections dealing with the theory of the addition of angular momenta and with collision theory. A new chapter on nuclear structure has been added; in accordance with the general plan of the course, the subjects in question are discussed only to the extent that is proper without an accompanying detailed analysis of the experimental results.

We should like to express our thanks to all our many colleagues whose comments have been utilized in the revision of the book. Numerous comments were received from V. L. Ginzburg and Ya. A. Smorodinskii. We are especially grateful to L. P. Pitaevskii for the great help which he has given in checking the formulae and the problems.

Our sincere thanks are due to Dr. Sykes and Dr. Bell, who not only translated excellently both the first and the second edition of the book, but also made a number of useful comments and assisted in the detection of various misprints in the first edition.

Finally, we are grateful to the Pergamon Press, which always acceded to our requests during the production of the book.
